DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for the Gobabeb dune scoop sample, analyzed in CheMin cell
 number 7a (Mylar window). This emptied cell had previously been used to
 analyze a Rocknest scoop sample. The 52 minor frames of best data quality
 from sol 1236 to sol 1256 were selected and averaged, including 9360
 individual 10-second frames in the 52 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. Grain motion in the cell was produced by vibration of adjacent cell
 pair 8, a method that prevents ejection of a loose sand sample such as
 Gobabeb; this method was proved in prior analysis of the scoop sample
 Rocknest. Note that EE1 frames from the downlink of sol 1229 were excluded
 from this table, because those frames were processed with a high DN
 threshold (150); the EE1 frames from sol 1236 are the same data collection
 but processed with a threshold of 50 DN. Also note that following the
 analysis of Gobabeb by indirect vibrataion of cell pair 8, further analyses
 were made by direct vibration of cell pair 7, in order to test the effects
 of differences in vibration level. The RE1 file from direct vibration of the
 Gobabeb sample is CMB_509596051RE112630530000CH00111P1. CCD temperatures
 during data collection were ~-50 Degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table
 shows energy in keV converted from Digital number (DN) using a conversion
 factor of 132.7076 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha
 peak at DN 919. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1500 (0.38430 to 11.30305
 keV), 1450 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of
 keV in column 1."
