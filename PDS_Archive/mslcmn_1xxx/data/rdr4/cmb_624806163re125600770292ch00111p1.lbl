 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 8a (Mylar window), which
 had held the drill samples Greenhorn, Lubango, Aberlady, and subsequently
 the second Glen Etive drill sample. The 4 minor frames of best data quality
 from sol 2560 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-
 second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A
 threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were
 ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV
 converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 128.8087
 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 892.
 Results are listed from DN 51 to 1575 (0.39594 to 12.22744 keV), 1525
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
