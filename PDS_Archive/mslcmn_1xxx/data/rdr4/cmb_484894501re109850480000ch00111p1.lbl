 fluorescence data for the quartz:beryl 88:12 diffraction standard in CheMin
 cell number 6b (Kapton window). The 2 minor frames of best data quality from
 sol 985 were selected and averaged, including 360 individual 10-second
 frames in the 2 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50
 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees
 centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital
 number (DN) using a conversion factor of 132.4910 DN/keV, based on position
 of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 917.5. Results are listed from DN 51
 to 1590 (0.38493 to 12.00082 keV), 1540 entries. Column 2 lists the log
 scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
