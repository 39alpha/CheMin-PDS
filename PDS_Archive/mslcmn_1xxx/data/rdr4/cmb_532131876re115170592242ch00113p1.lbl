DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 5a (Kapton window). This
 cell had held the sample Quela. The four minor frames of best data quality
 from sol 1517 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10
 second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A
 threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were
 ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV
 converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 132.1300
 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 915.
 Results are listed from DN 51 to 1890 (0.38598 to 14.30410 keV), 1840
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
