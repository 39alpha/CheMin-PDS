 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 5a (Kapton window). This
 cell had held the sample Quela; the sample had been previously dumped, but
 sample remained in the cell and this analysis follows a dump cycle at
 higher (CHAOS) vibration. The minor frame of best data quality from sol
 1526 was selected, including 180 10-second frames. A threshold of 50 DN
 was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees
 centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from
 digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 131.2635 DN/keV, based on
 position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 909. Results are listed
 from DN 51 to 1575 (0.38853 to 11.99876 keV), 1525 entries. Column 2 lists
 the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
