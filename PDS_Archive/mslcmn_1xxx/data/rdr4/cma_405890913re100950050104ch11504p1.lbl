 data for the fifth scooped soil sample from the Rocknest target, analyzed in
 CheMin cell number 7a (Mylar window). The ten minor frames of best data
 quality from sol0095 to sol0120 were selected and averaged, including 1800
 individual 10-second frames in the 10 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
 Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN)
 using a conversion factor of 135.0181 DN/keV, based on position of the
 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 935. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1400
 (0.37773 to 10.36898 keV), 1350 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale
 intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
