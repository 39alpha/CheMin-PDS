 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Sebina drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 4b (Kapton window).
 The analysis is based on RDA file CMB_530590971RDA14990582136CH00113P1. That
 RDA file is from the first night of analysis, sol 1496-1497. Additional
 analyses of Sebina were obtained on subsequent nights, but warm temperatures
 inside CheMin (up to ~30 degrees centigrade, with correspondingly low
 relative humidity) caused conversion of gypsum to bassanite over time.
 Therefore these later analyses do not represent in situ mineralogy and are
 not used to determine the RDA diffraction pattern and MIN composition of the
 in situ sample. For comparison, the full RDA file for all four nights of
 analysis, which is not used to prepare a MIN file, is
 CMB_530590971RDA14990582136CH00113P2. Mineral identifications, abundances
 and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay minerals, were
 determined using the program JADE. Orthorhombic and monoclinic pyroxenes
 both appear to be present, with orthopyroxene predominant, but exact
 identification of individual pyroxenes is hampered by small abundances and
 only the percentage of total pyroxene is reported. In addition to the
 crystalline phases, the abundance of clay minerals was modeled using the
 program FULLPAT at ~19 +/- 10 weight% of the total sample. A broad rise in
 background is present and has been modeled using FULLPAT to indicate that
 ~51 +/- 25 weight% of the total sample consists of X-ray amorphous material.
 Column 1 of the table lists mineral identifications, column 2 lists the
 mineral abundances in weight percent. Errors shown in column 3 are 1-sigma
 and include the combined instrumental error plus analytical error estimated
 from seven separate JADE analyses by members of the CheMin team."
