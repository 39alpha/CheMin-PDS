 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the first Mary Anning drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 7a
 (Mylar window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_649856565RDA28420822176CH00111P1. Mineral identifications, abundances
 and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay minerals,
 were determined using the program JADE. Mineral identification as
 Fe-carbonate may include siderite and/or ankerite. In addition to these
 crystalline phases, the program FULLPAT was used to estimate the abundance
 of poorly crystalline clay minerals at ~28 +/- 10 weight% of the total
 sample. High intensity in the low 2-theta region and a broad amorphous hump
 were modeled using FULLPAT to indicate that ~27 +/- 20 weight% of the total
 sample consists of X-ray amorphous materials. Column 1 of the table lists
 mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight
 percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
