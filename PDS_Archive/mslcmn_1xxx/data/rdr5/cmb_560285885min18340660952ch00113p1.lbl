 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Ogunquit Beach scoop sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 1a (Kapton
 window). The analysis uses RDA file CMB_560285885RDA18340660952CH00113P1.
 That RDA file is based on the first three nights of analysis, with grain
 motion in the cell induced indirectly by vibration of adjacent cell pair 0,
 in order to minimize any sample loss from cell 1a. Mineral identifications,
 abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay
 minerals, were determined using the program JADE. In addition to the
 crystalline phases, the abundance of clay minerals was modeled using the
 program FULLPAT at ~7 +/- 3 weight% of the total sample. Much or all of the
 clay mineral contribution may represent contamination in the sampling chain
 from the clay-rich drill sample Sebina, which was delivered to CheMin
 before Ogunquit Beach. A broad rise in background is present and has been
 modeled using FULLPAT to indicate that ~40 +/- 20 weight% of the total
 sample consists of X-ray amorphous material. Column 1 of the table lists
 mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight
 percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
