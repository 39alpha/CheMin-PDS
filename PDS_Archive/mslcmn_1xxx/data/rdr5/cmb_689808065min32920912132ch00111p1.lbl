DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Zechstein drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 1a (Kapton
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_689808065RDA32920912132CH00111P1. That RDA file includes one night of
 analysis, with files produced on sol 3292. Warm temperatures inside CheMin
 (up to ~30 degrees centigrade, with correspondingly low relative humidity)
 cause conversion of gypsum to bassanite over time. This conversion is not
 significant until after the first night in CheMin (Vaniman et al., 2018,
 American Mineralogist 103, 1011-1020), so the first night of analysis
 represents the in-situ abundances of gypsum and bassanite. At Zechstein the
 drill appears to have penetrated a Ca-sulfate vein at depth, accounting for
 the exceptionally high abundance of gypsum. Mineral identifications,
 abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases were determined
 using the program JADE. No clay minerals were detected in Zechstein. In
 addition to the crystalline phases, high intensity in the low 2-theta
 region and a broad amorphous hump were modeled using FULLPAT to indicate
 that ~46 +/- 25 weight% of the total sample consists of X-ray amorphous
 material. Column 1 of the table lists mineral identifications, column 2
 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent, and column 3 indicates the
 estimated errors. All errors reported are 2-sigma."
