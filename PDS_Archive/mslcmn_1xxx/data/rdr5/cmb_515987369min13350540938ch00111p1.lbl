 the Okoruso drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 7b (Mylar window).
 The analysis is based on RDA file CMB_515987369RDA13350540938CH00111P1.
 Mineral identifications, abundances and analytical errors for crystalline
 phases were determined using the program JADE. In addition to the
 crystalline phases, a broad rise in background is present and has been
 modeled using the program FULLPAT to indicate that ~35 +/- 15 weight% of
 this sample consists of X-ray amorphous material. Column 1 of the table
 lists mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in
 weight percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical
 errors."
