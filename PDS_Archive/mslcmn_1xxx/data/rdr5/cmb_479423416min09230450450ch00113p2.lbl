 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Telegraph Peak drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 5b (Kapton
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_479423416RDA09230450450CH00113P2, which supplants the P1 version with a
 correction of the 1D diffraction pattern for a small cell offset.  Mineral
 identifications, abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases were
 determined using the program JADE. In addition to the crystalline phases, the
 abundance of the poorly crystalline phase opal-CT was modeled using the
 program FULLPAT at ~15 +/- 7 weight% of the total sample. A broad rise in
 background is present and has been modeled using the program FULLPAT to
 indicate that ~27 +/- 13 weight% of the total sample consists of X-ray
 amorphous material. Column 1 of the table lists mineral identifications,
 column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent, and column 3
 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
