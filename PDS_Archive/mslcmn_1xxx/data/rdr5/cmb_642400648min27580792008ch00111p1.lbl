 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Glasgow drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 7b (Mylar
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_642400648RDA27580792008CH00111P1. Mineral identifications, abundances
 and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay minerals,
 were determined using the program JADE. In addition to these crystalline
 phases, the program FULLPAT was used to estimate the abundance of poorly
 crystalline clay minerals at ~24 +/- 12 weight% of the total sample. High
 intensity in the low 2-theta region and a broad amorphous hump are modeled
 using FULLPAT to indicate that ~47 +/- 23 weight% of the total sample
 consists of X-ray amorphous materials.. Column 1 of the table lists mineral
 identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent,
 and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
