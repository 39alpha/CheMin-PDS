 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Gobabeb dune scoop sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 7a (Mylar
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_507241145RDA12360521162CH00113P1. This emptied cell had previously been
 used to analyze a Rocknest scoop sample. The table represents results from
 sequences uploaded from sol 1225 to sol 1243, including 60 minor frames that
 represent a total of 30 hours of analysis. Grain motion in the cell was
 produced by vibration of adjacent cell pair 8, a method that prevents
 ejection of a loose sand sample such as Gobabeb; this method was proved in
 prior analysis of the scoop sample Rocknest. Note that following the
 analysis of Gobabeb by indirect vibration of cell pair 8, further analyses
 were made by direct vibration of cell pair 7, in order to test the effects
 of differences in vibration level. The MIN file from direct vibration of the
 Gobabeb sample is CMB_509595663MIN12630530000CH00111P1. Mineral
 identifications, abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases
 were determined using the program JADE. In addition to the crystalline
 phases, a broad rise in background is present and has been modeled using the
 program FULLPAT to indicate that ~34 +/- 18 weight% of this sample consists
 of X-ray amorphous material. Column 1 of the table lists mineral
 identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent,
 and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
