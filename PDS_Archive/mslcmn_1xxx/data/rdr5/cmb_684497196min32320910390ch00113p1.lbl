 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Maria Gordon drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 1a (Kapton
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_684497196RDA32320910390CH00113P1. Mineral identifications, abundances
 and analytical errors for crystalline phases were determined using the
 program JADE. The Maria Gordon sample may contain a small amount of
 ankerite and/or dolomite, but if present the abundance is too low (~1% or
 less) to report. High intensity in the low 2-theta region and a broad
 amorphous hump were modeled using the program FULLPAT to indicate that ~54
 +/- 24 weight% of the total sample consists of X-ray amorphous materials.
 All errors cited are 2-sigma. Column 1 of the table lists mineral
 identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent,
 and column 3 indicates the estimated analytical errors."
