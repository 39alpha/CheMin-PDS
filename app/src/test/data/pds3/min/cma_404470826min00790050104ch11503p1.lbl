 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the fourth scooped soil sample from the Rocknest target, analyzed in CheMin
 cell number 1a (Kapton window). The analysis is based on the level 1B EDR
 file CMA_404470826RDA00790050104CH11503P1. Mineral identifications,
 abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases were determined
 using the program TOPAS. In addition to the crystalline phases, a broad
 rise in background is present and has been modeled using the program
 FULLPAT to indicate that ~27 weight% of this sample consists of X-ray
 amorphous material; errors on this estimate may be ~50% relative.
 Column 1 of the table lists mineral identifications, column 2 lists the
 mineral abundances in weight percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated
 2-sigma analytical errors."
