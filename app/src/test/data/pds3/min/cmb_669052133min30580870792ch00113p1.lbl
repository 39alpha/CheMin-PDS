 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Nontron drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 9a (Mylar window).
 The analysis is based on RDA file CMB_669052133RDA30580870792CH00113P1.
 Mineral identifications, abundances and analytical errors for crystalline
 phases, other than clay minerals, were determined using the program JADE.
 In addition to these crystalline phases, the program FULLPAT was used to
 estimate the abundance of poorly crystalline clay minerals at ~18 +/- 8
 weight% of the total sample. High intensity in the low 2-theta region and a 
 broad amorphous hump were modeled using FULLPAT to indicate that ~40 +/- 24
 weight% of the total sample consists of X-ray amorphous materials. Opal-CT
 may be present at ~1%. All errors cited are 2-sigma. Column 1 of the table
 lists mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in
 weight percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated analytical errors."
