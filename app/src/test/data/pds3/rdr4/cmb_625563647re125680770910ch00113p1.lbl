 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 13b (Mylar window), which
 had held the drill samples John Klein and Duluth. The 4 minor frames of
 best data quality from sol 2568 were selected and averaged, including 720
 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy
 in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of
 129.6751 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN
 898. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1925 (0.39329 to 14.84479 keV), 1875
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
