 fluorescence data for the sample Maria Gordon in CheMin cell number 1a
 (Kapton window), which had previously held the samples Rocknest scoop 3,
 Rocknest scoop 4, Ogunquit Beach, and subsequently Pontours. The 13 minor
 frames of best data quality from sol 3232 were selected and averaged,
 including 2340 individual 10-second frames in the 13 minor frames of 180
 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures
 during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table
 shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion
 factor of 128.8281 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.400 keV Fe K-alpha
 peak at DN 824.5. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1500 (0.39588 to
 11.64342 keV), 1450 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for
 each value of keV in column 1."
