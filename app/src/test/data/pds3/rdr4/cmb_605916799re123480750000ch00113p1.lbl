 fluorescence data for empty, unused CheMin cell number 9b
 (Mylar window). The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 2348 
 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in
 the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was
 used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees
 centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from
 digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 128.6643 DN/keV, based on
 position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 891. Results are listed
 from DN 51 to 1300 (0.39638 to 10.10382 keV), 1250 entries. Column 2 lists
 the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
