DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains energy-single fluorescence
 data for the fifth scooped soil sample from the Rocknest target, analyzed in
 CheMin cell number 7a (Mylar window). This analysis was obtained with the
 lowest vibration mode possible, in order to determine whether grain size
 information could be obtianed from the diffraction rings. For the RE1 energy
 data, the two minor frames of best data quality from sol0149 were selected
 and averaged, including 360 individual 10-second frames in the 2 minor frames
 of 180 10-second frames each. CCD temperatures during data collection were
 ~-50 degrees centigrade.  Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted
 from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 135.1625 DN/keV, based
 on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 936. Results are listed
 from DN 51 to 1400 (0.37732 to 10.35791 keV), 1350 entries. Column 2 lists
 the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
