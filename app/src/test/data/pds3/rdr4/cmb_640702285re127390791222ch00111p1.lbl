 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 7b (Mylar window),
 which had previously held the samples Big Sky, Okoruso, Rock Hall, and
 subsequently Edinburgh. The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol
 2739 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames
 in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was
 used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
 Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number
 (DN) using a conversion factor of 127.7978 DN/keV, based on position of the
 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 885. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1500
 (0.39907 to 11.73729 keV), 1450 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale
 intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
