 data for empty CheMin cell number 12b (Mylar window) prior to loading with
 the Cumberland drill powder. The two minor frames of best data quality from
 sol0278 were selected and averaged, including 360 individual 10-second frames
 in the 2 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A higher threshold
 (150 DN) was used than in EE1 products used prior to sol0278 (50 DN). CCD 
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
 Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number
 (DN) using a conversion factor of 133.2582 DN/keV, based on position of the
 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 923. Results are listed from DN 151 to 1400
 (1.13314 to 10.50592 keV), 1250 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale
 intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
