 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains diffraction-all K-alpha
 diffraction data for the Gobabeb dune scoop sample, analyzed in CheMin cell
 number 7a (Mylar window). This emptied cell had previously been used to
 analyze a Rocknest scoop sample. The table represents results from sequences
 uploaded from sol 1262 to sol 1279, including 45 minor frames that represent
 a total of 22.5 hours of analysis. Grain motion in the cell was produced by
 direct vibration of cell pair 7, whereas the principal analysis of Gobabeb
 was by indirect vibration applied to adjacent cell pair 8, to prevent
 possible ejection of the very loose Gobabeb sand. For the principal RDA file
 of Gobabeb by indirect vibration, see RDA file
 CMB_507241145RDA12360521162CH00113P1. An increase in Mylar diffuse
 scattering at ~19 degrees 2-theta, with direct vibration, indicates
 that some of the sample was ejected when direct vibration was applied.
 Refined plagioclase c and gamma cell parameters for the Gobabeb sample at
 direct vibration were used to make a minor adjustment in the sample to
 detector distance, reducing this by 36 um. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table lists 2-theta
 from 2.00 to 52.00 degrees cobalt K-alpha, in increments of 0.05 degrees
 (1001 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity of the diffraction for each 2
 theta value in column 1."
