 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains diffraction-all K-alpha
 diffraction data for the fifth scooped soil sample from the Rocknest target,
 analyzed in CheMin cell number 7a (Mylar window). The analysis was obtained
 with minimal possible vibration in distant cell pair 13, in order to try and
 get a pattern in cell 7a with no grain motion. However, results showed that
 there was still grain motion in cell 7a. For a better and more complete
 analysis of the fifth scooped soil sample from Rocknest see the
 diffraction-all product CMA_405889312RDA00950050104CH11504P1 and the mineral
 abundance product CMA_405889312MIN00950050104CH11504P1.The table shown here
 for the minimal-vibration analysis represents results from sequences uploaded
 on sol0148, using 10 second frames. The total analysis includes 7 minor
 frames collected during slightly more than 3 hours of total analysis time.
 CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
 Column 1 of the table lists 2-theta from 3.00 to 51.95 degrees cobalt
 K-alpha, in increments of 0.05 degrees (980 entries). Column 2 lists the
 intensity of the diffraction for each 2-theta value in column 1."
