DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains diffraction-all K-alpha
 diffraction data for the Rock Hall drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell
 number 7b (Mylar window). The table represents results from sequences
 uploaded on sol 2264, including the 4 initial minor frames that represent 2
 hours of analysis. Although a total of 15 minor frames were collected in
 this first night of analysis, a drop in sample signal beyond the first four
 minor frames indicated that much of the sample had moved to portions of the
 cell outside the X-ray beam; when sample signal rose again toward the end
 of this analysis, grain motion deteriorated significantly. Additional
 nights of analysis on sols 2277-2278 and 2285-2286 showed no improvement in
 grain motion, even as attempts were made to increase sample vibration
 intensity. An RDA for this later analyses has been generated as
 CMA_599656708RDA22770731206CH00113P1, but that RDA has not been used to
 prepare a MIN file because of the very poor grain motion in these
 subsequent nights of analysis. To focus on the highest quality data, the
 RDA file listed here and used for mineralogical analysis (see file
 CMA_598547494MIN22650731206CH00111P1) contains only the first four minor
 frames where signal remained strong and grain motion was good.  Refined  
 plagioclase c and gamma cell parameters were used to make a minor
 adjustment in the sample to detector distance, reducing this by 69 um. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table lists 2-theta from 2.00 to 52.00 degrees cobalt K-alpha, in
 increments of 0.05 degrees (1001 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity of
 the diffraction for each 2-theta value in column 1."
