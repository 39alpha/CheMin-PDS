 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains diffraction-all
 K-alpha diffraction data for the Ogunquit Beach scoop sample, analyzed in
 CheMin cell number 1a (Kapton window). This cell had previously been used
 to analyze scoop samples 3 and 4 of Rocknest sand. The table represents
 results from sequences uploaded on sol 1931, including 15 minor frames that
 represent a total of 7.5 hours of analysis. Cell vibration was induced
 directly, in a test of this vibration mode against the previous results
 from sequences uploaded from sol 1831 to sol 1845, where grain motion was
 induced indirectly for three nights (total 22.5 hours) by vibrating
 adjacent cell pair 0 in order to avoid sample loss of the loose Ogunquit
 Beach sand (the indirect vibration RDA file for Ogunquit Beach is
 CMB_560285885RDA18340660952CH00113P1, and is considered to be the best
 representative analysis). In all RDA files for Ogunquit Beach, refined
 plagioclase c and gamma cell parameters were used to make a minor
 adjustment in the sample to detector distance, reducing this by 89 um. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the RDA table lists 2-theta from 2.00 to 52.00 degrees cobalt K-alpha,
 in increments of 0.05 degrees (1001 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity
 of the diffraction for each 2-theta value in column 1."
