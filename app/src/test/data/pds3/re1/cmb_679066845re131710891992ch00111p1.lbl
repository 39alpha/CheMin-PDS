 fluorescence data for the sample Pontours in CheMin cell number 1a
 (Kapton window), which had previously held the samples Rocknest
 (scoops 3 and 4) and subsequently Ogunquit Beach. The 13 minor frames of
 best data quality from sol 3171 were selected and averaged, including 2340
 individual 10-second frames in the 13 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy
 in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of
 128.5156 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.400 keV Fe K-alpha peak at DN
 822.5. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1525 (0.39684 to 11.86626 keV),
 1475 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV
 in column 1."
