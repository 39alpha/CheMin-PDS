DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for pristine CheMin cell number 15a (Kapton window). The
 single minor frame of best data quality from sol 3225 includes 180
 individual 10-second frames. Note that a single minor frame produces 
 relatively poor resolution of the major energy peaks (Ca, Fe, and Co). A
 threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were
 ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV
 converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 126.9314
 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 879.
 Results are listed from DN 51 to 1065 (0.40179 to 8.39036 keV), 1015
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
