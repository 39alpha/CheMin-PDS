 fluorescence data for pristine CheMin cell number 4a (Kapton window). The 4
 minor frames of best data quality from sol 3088 were selected and averaged,
 including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-
 second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during
 data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows
 energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor
 of 126.9314 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at
 DN 879. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1450 (0.40179 to 11.42349 keV),
 1400 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV
 in column 1."
