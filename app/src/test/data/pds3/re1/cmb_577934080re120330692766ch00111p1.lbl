 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 13a
 (Mylar window). This cell had previously contained a delivery of drill
 sample Windjana and a subsequent delivery of drill sample Oudam. The 4
 minor frames of best data quality from sol 2033 were selected and averaged,
 including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10
 second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during
 data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows
 energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor
 of 130.5415 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at
 DN 904. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1850 (0.39068 to 14.17174 keV),
 1800 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV
 in column 1."
