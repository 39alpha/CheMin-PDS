DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for the Ogunquit Beach scoop sample in CheMin cell number
 1a (Kapton window). The 13 minor frames of best data quality from sol 1934
 were selected and averaged, including 2340 individual 10-second frames
 in the 13 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. These data are from
 operation of the sample cell with direct vibration, which tends to eject
 some sample grains. Prior analysis under indirect vibration was of longer
 duration and produced the best data for this sample; the RE1 product for
 that analysis can be found in file CMB_560286272RE118340660952CH00113P1A. 
 For all analyses of Ogunquit Beach a CCD threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a
 conversion factor of 131.1191 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co
 K-alpha peak at DN 908. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1835 (0.38896 to
 13.99491 keV), 1785 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for
 each value of keV in column 1."
