 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 1a (Kapton window). This
 cell had held the samples Rocknest3 and Rocknest4. The four minor frames of
 best data quality from sol 1589 were selected and averaged, including 720
 individual 10 second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy
 in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of
 131.1191 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN
 908. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1450 (0.38896 to 11.05865 keV), 1400
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
