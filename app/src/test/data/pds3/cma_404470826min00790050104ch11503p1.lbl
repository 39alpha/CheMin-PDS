 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the John Klein drill sample, analyzed in CheMin
 cell number 13b (Mylar window). The analysis is based on the level 1B EDR 
 file CMA_414856883RDA01960060000CH12240P1. Mineral identifications,
 abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay 
 minerals, were determined using the program TOPAS.  The abundance of clay 
 minerals was estimated separately, using the program FULLPAT, at ~22 +/- 11 
 weight% of the total sample mass. In addition to the crystalline phases, a 
 broad rise in background is present and has been modeled using the program 
 FULLPAT to indicate that ~28 +/- 15 weight% of this sample consists of X-ray 
 amorphous material; a small amount of this may consist of allophane-like
 material. Column 1 of the table lists mineral identifications, column 2 
 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent, and column 3 indicates the
 estimated 2-sigma analytical errors. This is a preliminary analysis; 
 additional analysis time was accumulated after sol 269 and an updated 
 mineral abundance table will be provided in the next data delivery."
