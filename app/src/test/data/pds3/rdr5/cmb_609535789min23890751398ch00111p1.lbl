 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Kilmarie drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 9b (Mylar
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMB_609535789RDA23890751398CH00111P1. That RDA file includes analyses
 from sols 2389, 2391, 2395, 2396, and 2401. Mineral identifications,
 abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay
 minerals, were determined using the program JADE; these results are listed
 in the table normalized to 100%. Column 1 of the table lists mineral
 identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight percent,
 and column 3 indicates the estimated 1-sigma analytical errors between JADE
 analyses by six independent analysts. In addition to the crystalline
 phases, the abundance of clay minerals was estimated at ~28 +/- 12 weight%.
 A broad rise in background is present and has been modeled using FULLPAT to
 indicate that ~44 +/- 20 weight% of the total sample consists of X-ray
 amorphous material."
