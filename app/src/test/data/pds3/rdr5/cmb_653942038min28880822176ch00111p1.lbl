DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the second Mary Anning drill sample, labelled Mary Anning 3. The sample was
 analyzed in CheMin cell number 7a (Mylar window). The analysis is based on
 RDA file CMB_653942038RDA28880822176CH00111P1. Mineral identifications,
 abundances and analytical errors for crystalline phases, other than clay
 minerals, were determined using the program JADE. Mineral identification as
 Fe-carbonate may include siderite and/or ankerite. In addition to these
 crystalline phases, the program FULLPAT was used to estimate the abundance
 of poorly crystalline clay minerals at ~30 +/- 11 weight% of the total
 sample. High intensity in the low 2-theta region and a broad amorphous hump
 were modeled using FULLPAT to indicate that ~25 +/- 19 weight% of the total
 sample consists of X-ray amorphous materials. Column 1 of the table lists
 mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight
 percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
