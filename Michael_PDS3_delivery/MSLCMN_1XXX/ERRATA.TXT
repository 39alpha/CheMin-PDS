During the course of the MSL mission the CheMin Science Team may update
previously released data products or documentation. Updates will be
reported in this file, ERRATA.TXT. Older versions of data and documentation 
will be retained in the archive no longer than six months.

Section A of this file contains an entry for each CheMin RDR data release, 
with most recent entries listed first. Updates to previously released files 
are reported in these entries, along with any known errata.

In Release 26, the DESCRIPTION section of the PDS label for
CMB_656074041RE129120822188CH00111P1 incorrectly listed Co rather than Fe as
the basis for converting DN to keV. This is corrected in Release 31.
Similarly, in Release 30, the DESCRIPTION section of the PDS label for
CMB_692810486RE133260920270CH00111P1 incorrectly listed Co rather than Fe as

Plagioclase cell parameters are now being used to correct for small
deviations in sample to detector distance. Three earlier analyses, made 
before this method was developed, have been corrected in Release 12. The
corrections affect both the level-4 RDA and level-5 MIN files for these three
samples. The three samples and the P2 corrected files are listed below.
Confidence Hills, corrected in:
CMB_465487684RDA07660421020CH00113P2

Some EDRs for Buckskin were obtained at the end of the sol range for release
10 (sol 1062), but analysis of Buckskin was not complete until
after that sol. For this reason, the RDRs for Buckskin are not in release
10 but will be in release 11, which will be available on March 16, 2016.

Three RE1 products in release 6 had csv data files in which the KEV and
INTENSITY column labels were switched. These three csv files have been
replaced. The lbl files for each have been updated with the new
PRODUCT_CREATION_TIME and with PRODUCT_VERSION_ID incremented from 1.0
to 1.1. The three csv files are:
CMB_439549929RE104740240192CH00111P1.csv

Note that RDR4 and RDR5 products for a second analysis of the Windjana drill
sample were not prerpared from the EDR files. This second analysis was a test
of sample cell reuse in which a portion of the Windjana drill powder was
delivered to previously used sample cell 12b, in which the Cumberland drill 
powder had been analyzed. Remnants of the Cumberland sample and poor powder
motion during analysis produced a very poor diffraction pattern and mixed
energy products. For these reasons the results were compromised and the
level 4 and level 5 data products were not produced. EDR files that were
not used are those collected from sol 642 (SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT
454452531.148) through sol 695 (SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT 459157212.363).

For one product released in Release 3, CMA_414856883MIN01960060000CH12240P1,
