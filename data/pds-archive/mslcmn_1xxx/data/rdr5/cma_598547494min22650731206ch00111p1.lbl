DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains mineral abundances and
 analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
 the Rock Hall drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 7b (Mylar
 window). The analysis is based on RDA file
 CMA_598547494RDA22650731206CH00111P1. That RDA file represents the first
 four minor frames produced during the first night of analysis, on sol 2265.
 Although a total of 15 minor frames were collected in this first night of
 analysis, a drop in sample signal beyond the first four minor frames
 indicated that much of the sample had moved to portions of the cell outside
 the X-ray beam; when sample signal rose again toward the end of this
 analysis, grain motion deteriorated significantly. Additional nights of
 analysis on sols 2277-2278 and 2285-2286 showed no improvement in grain
 motion, even as attempts were made to increase sample vibration intensity.
 To focus on the highest quality data, the RDA file associated with this
 label and used for mineralogical analysis includes only the first four
 minor frames where signal remained strong and grain motion was good.
 Mineral identifications, abundances and analytical errors for crystalline
 phases, other than clay minerals, were determined using the program JADE.
 In addition to the crystalline phases, the abundance of poorly-crystalline
 clay minerals was modeled using the program FULLPAT at ~13 +/- 6 weight% of
 the total sample. A broad rise in background is present and has been
 modeled using FULLPAT to indicate that ~34 +/- 15 weight% of the total
 sample consists of X-ray amorphous material. Column 1 of the table lists
 mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in weight
 percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical errors."
