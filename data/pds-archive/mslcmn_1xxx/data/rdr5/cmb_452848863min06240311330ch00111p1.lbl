analytical errors derived from diffraction-all K-alpha diffraction data for
the Windjana drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell number 13a (Mylar window).
The analysis is based on RDA file CMB_452848863RDA06240311330CH00111P1.
Mineral identifications, abundances and analytical errors for crystalline
phases, other than clay minerals, were determined using the program TOPAS.
The mineral reported as K-feldspar is fit equally well as either sanidine
or orthoclase. The abundance of clay minerals was estimated separately, using
the program FULLPAT, at ~8.2 +/- 4 weight% of the total sample mass. In
addition to the crystalline phases, a broad rise in background is present and
has been modeled using the program FULLPAT to indicate that ~20 +/- 11
weight% of this sample consists of X-ray amorphous material. Column 1 of the
table lists mineral identifications, column 2 lists the mineral abundances in
weight percent, and column 3 indicates the estimated 2-sigma analytical
errors."
