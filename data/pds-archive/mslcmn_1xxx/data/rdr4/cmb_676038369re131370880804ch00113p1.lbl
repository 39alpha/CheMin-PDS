 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 1a (Kapton window), which
 had previously held the samples Rocknest (scoops 3 and 4) and subsequently
 Ogunquit Beach. The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 3137 were
 selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4
 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used.
 CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
 Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number
 (DN) using a conversion factor of 126.9314 DN/keV, based on position of
 the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 879. Results are listed from DN 51 to
 1550 (0.40179 to 12.21132 keV), 1500 entries. Column 2 lists the
 log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
