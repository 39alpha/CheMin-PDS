 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 6a (Kapton window), which
 had held the sample Mojave2. The 4 minor frames of best data quality from
 sol 1045 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second
 frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50
 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees
 centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital
 number (DN) using a conversion factor of 132.9964 DN/keV, based on position
 of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 921. Results are listed from DN 51
 to 1596 (0.38347 to 12.00033 keV), 1546 entries. Column 2 lists the log
 scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
