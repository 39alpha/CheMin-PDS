 fluorescence data for emptied sample Cumberland in CheMin cell number 9a
 (Mylar window), which had previously held the sample Groken
 and subsequently Nontron. The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol
 3197 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second
 frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of
 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees
 centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from
 digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 128.8281 DN/keV, based on
 position of the 6.400 keV Fe K-alpha peak at DN 824.5. Results are listed
 from DN 51 to 1750 (0.39588 to 13.58399 keV), 1700 entries. Column 2 lists
 the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
