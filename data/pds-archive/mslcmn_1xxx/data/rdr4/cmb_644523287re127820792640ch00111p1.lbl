 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 7b (Mylar window),
 which had held the samples Big Sky, Okoruso, Rock Hall, Edinburgh, and
 subsequently Glasgow. The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 2782
 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in
 the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was
 used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
 Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number
 (DN) using a conversion factor of 1279.2188 DN/keV, based on position of
 the 6.400 keV Fe K-alpha peak at DN 827. Results are listed from DN 51 to
 1900 (4.74740 to 14.70375 keV), 1850 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale
 intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
