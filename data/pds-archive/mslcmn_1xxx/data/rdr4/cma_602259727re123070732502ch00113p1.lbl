 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 8a (Mylar window) which
 had held the samples Greenhorn and subsequently Lubango.
 The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 2307 were selected and
 averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames
 of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a
 conversion factor of 128.8087 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co
 K-alpha peak at DN 892. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1400 (0.39594 to
 10.86883 keV), 1350 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for
 each value of keV in column 1."
