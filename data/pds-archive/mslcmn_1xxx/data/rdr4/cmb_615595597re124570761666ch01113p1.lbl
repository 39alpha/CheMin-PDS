DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 9b (Mylar window), which
 had held the drill sample Kilmarie. This was an attempt to dislodge
 remnants of the sample that were not removed in the prior attempt to empty
 this cell on sol 2436. This second attempt to empty the cell was not
 successful, and Kilmarie material remains in the cell. The 4 minor frames
 of best data quality from sol 2457 were selected and averaged, including
 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second
 frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy
 in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of
 129.3863 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN
 896. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1850 (0.39417 to 14.29827 keV), 1800
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
