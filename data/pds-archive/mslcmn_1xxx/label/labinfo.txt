The LABEL directory contains format files (extension .FMT) that are
referenced in the PDS labels for data products in this archive. Each data 
product is described by a PDS label in a separate file. The label includes a 
description of the data file format, e.g. the start byte, number of bytes, 
data type, description, and other information for each field in the data 
file. Since some files have many columns, the label descriptions can be very 
lengthy. To avoid repeating the same descriptive information in every label, 
the information is extracted into a format file. The label then contains a 
pointer to the format file, e.g. ^STRUCTURE = CHEMIN_XRD.FMT.

The following format files are in this directory:

CHEMIN_EDH.FMT - Energy table data columns
CHEMIN_MIN.FMT - Mineral abundance table data columns
CHEMIN_XRD.FMT - Diffraction table data columns
