The CATALOG directory contains mission, spacecraft (instrument host),
instrument, reference, personnel, and data set descriptions for 
the MSL CheMin RDR archive.

The descriptions are in text files with names ending in CAT. They are 
called catalog files because they are written in a keyword = value format
that enables them to be loaded into the PDS online catalog for searching.  
They may be read in a text editor.
