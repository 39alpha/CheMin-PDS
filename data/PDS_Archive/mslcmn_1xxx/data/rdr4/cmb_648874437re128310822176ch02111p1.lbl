 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 7a
 (Mylar window), which had previously held the scooped samples Rocknest (5th
 scoop)and Gobabeb. A single minor frames of best data quality from sol 2831 
 provides 180 10-second frames. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a
 conversion factor of 126.7870 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co
 K-alpha peak at DN 930. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1300 (0.40225 to
 10.25342 keV), 1250 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for
 each value of keV in column 1."
