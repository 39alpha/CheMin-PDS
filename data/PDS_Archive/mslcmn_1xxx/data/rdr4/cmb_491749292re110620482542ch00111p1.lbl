 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for the sample Buckskin in CheMin cell number 14b (Kapton
 window). The three minor frames of best data quality from sol 1062 were
 selected and averaged, including 540 individual 10-second frames in the
 three minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. The table represents
 results from sequences uploaded on sol 1061; of the 15 minor frames
 collected, the first four produced diffraction with good grain motion but
 the last eleven produced spotty and poor diffraction, suggesting packing of
 the sample. Two more nights of analysis, on sols 1073-1074 and 1078-1079,
 both with 15 minor frames at higher vibration level, did not improve grain
 motion. For this reason only the best three of the first four minor frames
 from sol 1061-1062 are used to produce the Buckskin RE1 file (the first
 frame is not used as the CCD temperature tends to decline slightly as
 analysis begins). A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during
 data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows
 energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor
 of 132.8520 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN
 920. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1500 (0.38389 to 11.29076 keV), 1450
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
