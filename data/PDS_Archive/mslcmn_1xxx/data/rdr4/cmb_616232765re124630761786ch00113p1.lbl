 fluorescence data for emmptied CheMin cell number 10a (Mylar window), which
 had held the drill sample Stoer and subsequently Highfield. The 4 minor
 frames of best data quality from sol 2463 were selected and averaged,
 including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10
 second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during
 data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows
 energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor
 of 129.3863 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at
 DN 896. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1800 (0.39417 to 13.91183 keV),
 1750 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV
 in column 1."
