 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains diffraction-all K-alpha
 diffraction data for the Buckskin drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell
 number 14b (Kapton window). The table represents results from sequences
 uploaded on sols 1073 and 1078. Note that these results represent an attempt
 to improve grain motion and diffraction quality, by increasing vibration
 level, following apparent packing of the sample part way through the
 analysis uploaded on sol 1061. Diffraction quality did not improve, so for
 the highest quality diffraction data refer to RDA file
 CMB_491748904RDA10620482542CH00111P1 and the associated mineral abundance
 file CMB_491748904MIN10620482542CH00111P1. In the EDA source files for the
 RDA data presented here, the effects of poor grain motion are reflected in
 Debye rings with irregular intensity, but the RDA pattern is provided for
 those who may wish to compare these results with the higher-quality RDA
 pattern of CMB_491748904RDA10620482542CH00111P1. The 30 minor frames of the
 sol 1073-1074 and sol1078-1079 analyses represent 14.98 hours of analysis.
 Refined plagioclase c and gamma cell parameters from
 CMB_491748904RDA10620482542CH00111P1 were used to make a minor adjustment in
 the sample to detector distance, reducing this by 67 um. CCD temperatures
 during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table
 lists 2-theta from 2.00 to 52.00 degrees cobalt K-alpha, in increments of
 0.05 degrees (1001 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity of the diffraction
 for each 2-theta value in column 1."
