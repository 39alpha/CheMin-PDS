 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 12a (Mylar
 window). This cell had held the sample Confidence Hills and, after
 Confidence Hills was emptied, the sample Oudam. The 13 minor frames of best
 data quality from sol 1736 were selected and averaged, including 2340
 individual 10-second frames in the 13 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy
 in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of
 131.1913 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN
 908.5. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1500 (0.38875 to 11.43368 keV),
 1450 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV
 in column 1."
