DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for pristine CheMin cell number 15a (Kapton window).
 The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 3505 were selected and
 averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames
 of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN);
 decreasing energy resolution with CCD age requires estimating the
 conversion of DN to keV based on more than one peak. For this analysis the
 usable peaks were Ca and Co. We used a conversion factor of 127 DN/keV,
 estimated from position of the 3.690 keV Ca K-alpha peak at DN 468.5 and
 the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 874.5. Results are listed from DN 51
 to 1350 (0.4016 to 10.6299 keV), 1300 entries. Column 2 lists the
 log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
