 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains diffraction-all K-alpha
 diffraction data for the Gobabeb dune scoop sample, analyzed in CheMin cell
 number 7a (Mylar window). This emptied cell had previously been used to
 analyze a Rocknest scoop sample. The table represents results from sequences
 uploaded from sol 1225 to sol 1243, including 60 minor frames that represent
 a total of 30 hours of analysis. Grain motion in the cell was produced by
 vibration of adjacent cell pair 8, a method that prevents ejection of a
 loose sand sample such as Gobabeb; this method was proved in prior analysis
 of the scoop sample Rocknest. Note that EDA frames from the downlink of sol
 1229 were excluded from this table, because those frames were processed
 without CCD 2D and hot pixel correction; the EDA frames from sol 1236 are
 the same data collection but processed with appropriate 2D and hot pixel
 correction, as were all subsequent Gobabeb EDA frames. Also note that
 following the analysis of Gobabeb by indirect vibration of cell pair 8,
 further analyses were made by direct vibration of cell pair 7, in order to
 test the effects of differences in vibration level. The RDA file from direct
 vibration of the Gobabeb sample is CMB_509595663RDA12630530000CH00111P1.
 Refined plagioclase c and gamma cell parameters for the Gobabeb sample at
 this indirect vibration mode were used to make a minor adjustment in the
 sample to detector distance, reducing this by 25 um. CCD temperatures during
 data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table lists 2- 
 theta from 1.95 to 52.00 degrees cobalt K-alpha, in increments of 0.05 
 degrees (1002 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity of the diffraction for
 each 2-theta value in column 1."
