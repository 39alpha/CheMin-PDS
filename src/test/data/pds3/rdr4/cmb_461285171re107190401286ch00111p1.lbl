fluorescence data for emptied cell 12b (Mylar window), which had been used
for the drill sample Cumberland and reused for a portion of the drill
sample Windjana. The 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 0719 were
selected and averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4
minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used.
CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade.
Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number(DN)
using a conversion factor of 133.574 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925
keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 925. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1867
(0.383811 to 13.977270 keV), 1817 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale
intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
