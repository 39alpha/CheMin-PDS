 fluorescence data for the sample Zechstein in CheMin cell number 1a
 (Kapton window), which had previously held the samples Rocknest
 scoop 3, Rocknest scoop 4, Ogunquit Beach, Pontours, and subsequently
 Maria Gordon. The 33 minor frames of best data quality from sols 3292,
 3299, 3310, 3320, 3350, and 3359 were selected and averaged, including 5940
 individual 10-second frames in the 33 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. The data from sol 3292 correspond with the initial night of analysis;
 data from subsequent sols are shorter analyses on or after the attempt to
 dump the cell on sol 3299. None of the dumps were successful, and the
 sample remained in the cell. These later analyses are included in the RE1
 file for Zechstein to provide the best RE1 analysis. A threshold of
 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees
 centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV converted from
 digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of 128.4375 DN/keV, based on
 position of the 6.400 keV Fe K-alpha peak at DN 822. Results are listed
 from DN 51 to 1720 (0.39708 to 13.39173 keV), 1670 entries. Column 2 lists
 the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
