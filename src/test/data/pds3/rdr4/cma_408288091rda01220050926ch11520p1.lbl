 minor frames collected during 2.98 hours of total analysis time. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table lists 2-theta from 3.00 to 51.95 degrees cobalt K-alpha, in
 increments of 0.05 degrees (980 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity of the
 diffraction for each 2-theta value in column 1."
