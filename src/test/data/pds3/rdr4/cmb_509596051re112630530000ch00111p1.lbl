DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for the Gobabeb dune scoop sample, analyzed in CheMin
 cell number 7a (Mylar window). This emptied cell had previously been used
 to analyze a Rocknest scoop sample. The 39 minor frames of best data quality
 from sol 1263 to sol 1281 were selected and averaged, including 7020
 individual 10-second frames in the 39 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection
 were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Grain motion in the cell was produced by
 direct vibration of cell pair 7, whereas the principal analysis of Gobabeb
 was by indirect vibration applied to adjacent cell pair 8, to prevent
 possible ejection of the very loose Gobabeb sand. For the principal RE1 file
 of Gobabeb by indirect vibration, see RE1 file
 CMB_507241532RE112360521162CH00113P1. An increase in Mylar diffuse
 scattering in RDA file CMB_509595663RDA12630530000CH00111P1 at ~19 degrees
 2-theta, with direct vibration, indicates that some of the sample was 
 ejected when direct vibration was applied. Column 1 of the table shows
 energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor
 of 132.4188 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN
 917. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1500 (0.38514 to 11.32770 keV), 1450
 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in
 column 1."
