 fluorescence data for pristine CheMin cell number 9a
 (Mylar window). A single minor frames of best data quality from sol 2831 
 provides 180 10-second frames. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a
 conversion factor of 129.7978 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co
 K-alpha peak at DN 885. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1200 (0.39907 to
 9.38983 keV), 1150 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each
 value of keV in column 1."
