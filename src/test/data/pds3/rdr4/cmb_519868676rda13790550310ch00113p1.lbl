 DESCRIPTION                  = "This table contains diffraction-all K-alpha
 diffraction data for the Oudam drill sample, analyzed in CheMin cell
 number 13a (Mylar window). This is the second delivery of a split of Oudam;
 the first delivery was to cell 12a (Mylar window) which had previously held
 the Confidence Hills sample. The Oudam delivery in cell 12a provided good
 grain motion and no evidence of contamination from Confidence Hills. The
 sample in cell 12a is therefore the primary Oudam sample and the RDA file
 for that sample is CMB_518482923RDA13630542280CH00113P1. Cell 13a had
 previously held the first delivery of the Windjana sample, which had very
 little plagioclase. Oudam has abundant plagioclase and analysis of a split
 of Oudam in cell 13a allows use of plagioclase cell parameters to determine
 the offset of the cell from nominal sample to detector distance. Refined
 plagioclase c and gamma cell parameters were used to make a minor adjustment
 in the sample to detector distance, reducing this by 60 um. Oudam grain
 motion in cell 13a was poor, with evidence that some Windjana powder
 remained in the cell. For these reasons the RDA file for Oudam in cell 13a
 is not used to develop a MIN file of mineral abundances (for an appropriate
 Oudam MIN file refer to CMB_518482923MIN13630542280CH00113P1, based on data
 from cell 12a). The RDA table for Oudam in cell 13a represents results from
 sequences uploaded on sols 1375 and 1387, including 30 minor frames that
 represent a total of 15.0 hours of analysis. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table lists 2-theta
 from 2.00 to 52.00 degrees cobalt K-alpha, in increments of 0.05 degrees
 (1001 entries). Column 2 lists the intensity of the diffraction for each 2
 theta value in column 1."
