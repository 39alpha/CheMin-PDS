 fluorescence data for pristine CheMin cell number 10a (Mylar window). The
 4 minor frames of best data quality from sol 2106 were selected and
 averaged, including 720 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames
 of 180 10-second frames each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD
 temperatures during data collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1
 of the table shows energy in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a
 conversion factor of 129.5307 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.925 keV Co
 K-alpha peak at DN 897. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1350 (0.39373 to
 10.42224 keV), 1300 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for
 each value of keV in column 1."
