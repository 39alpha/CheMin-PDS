DESCRIPTION                   = "This table contains energy-single
 fluorescence data for dumped CheMin cell number 15a (Kapton window), which
 had been used to hold the sample Avanavero. The 4 minor frames of best data
 quality from sol 3528 were selected and averaged, including 720 individual
 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames each. A
 threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data collection were
 ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy in keV
 converted from digital number (DN); decreasing energy resolution with CCD
 age requires estimating the conversion of DN to keV based on more than one
 peak. For this analysis the usable peaks were Ca and Co. We used a
 conversion factor of 127 DN/keV, estimated from position of the 3.690 keV
 Ca K-alpha peak at DN 471.5 and the 6.925 keV Co K-alpha peak at DN 875.
 Results are listed from DN 51 to 1350 (0.4016 to 10.6299 keV), 1300 entries.
 Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV in column 1."
