 fluorescence data for emptied CheMin cell number 9a (Mylar window), which
 had held the samples Groken and then Nontron. The 4 minor frames of best
 data quality from sol 3082 were selected and averaged, including 720
 individual 10-second frames in the 4 minor frames of 180 10-second frames
 each. A threshold of 50 DN was used. CCD temperatures during data
 collection were ~-50 degrees centigrade. Column 1 of the table shows energy
 in keV converted from digital number (DN) using a conversion factor of
 128.6563 DN/keV, based on position of the 6.400 keV Fe K-alpha peak at DN
 823.5. Results are listed from DN 51 to 1850 (0.396357 to 14.37766 keV),
 1800 entries. Column 2 lists the log-scale intensity for each value of keV
 in column 1."
